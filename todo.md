# Notes

By convention, npm i is usually run at the root of the project, not in a sub-directory (here, backend). I think we should change this.

## Tasks

[ ] Merge Svelte with Express
[ ] Ensure the Vite dist directory (after npm build) can communicate with the backend
[ ] Run both the backend server and the front-end simultaneously
  [ ] Copy the "backend" folder onto Svelte, and try to run both servers using two terminals

## Concerns or Questions

- Is dbinfo.txt supposed to be the .env file? If so, should we write a note to convert it to .env and fill the values at the top of that file?
