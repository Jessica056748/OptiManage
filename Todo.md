# Notes
By convention, npm i is usually run at the root of the project, not in a sub-directory (here, backend). I think we should change this.

## Tasks
- [ ] Merge Svelte with Express  
- [ ] Ensure the Vite dist directory (after npm build) can communicate with the backend
- [ ] Run both the backend server and the front-end simultaneously
  - Copy the "backend" folder onto Svelte, and try to run both servers using two terminals
